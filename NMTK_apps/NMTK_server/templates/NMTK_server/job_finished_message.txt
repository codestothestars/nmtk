You recently submitted a job using the NMTK server at http{% if request.is_secure %}s{% endif %}://{{site.domain}}{% url 'nmtk_server_nmtk_index' %}.

We are pleased to report that your job was submitted to the "{{tool.name}}"
and a response indicating the job has completed was returned by the tool!  

The final response from the tool was "{{job.get_status_display}}".

Please note that the NMTK Server submits your job to the tool, which performs
the requested processing, and returns a result.  Generally, responses returned
by the tool fall into one of several categories:

  * Tool Failed to Accept Job - This indicates that the tool server was 
    unavailable (offline), or it suffered from some error that resulted in
    it not being able to accept the job.  You might try contacting the tool 
    maintainer, or simply try again at a later date.

  * Failed - The tool accepted the job, but returned a response indicating 
    that processing of the job failed.  In some cases, the status (available
    via the NMTK server) will indicate what went wrong.  This can often be due
    to a set of invalid parameters that were sent, or some internal issue with
    the tool itself.
    
  * Completed - The tool accepted the job, processed it, and returned a 
    well-formated result back to the NMTK server.  You can view the results on
    the NMTK server itself (using the link in this email) by logging into your
    account.
    
If the result is not "Completed", you should review the response returned by the
tool (in the case of Failed) and correct your data (if possible.) or contact the
maintainer of the "{{tool.name}}" tool to figure out what might be wrong.
