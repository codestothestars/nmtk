'''
This module is designed to handle some account loading - basically, when
a new account is generated, a signal will call the setupAccount function, which
should take the account information and use it to perform some basic setup steps -
basically loading a base data file into the account.

Ideally, this would be called after the account is activated, since at that time
we know that the account is real.  If we do it any other way, then we run into
issues with regard to this being used as a vector for DOS attacks.
